""""Pure functions defining the prioritised trajectory buffer. The trajectory buffer takes batches
of n-step experience data, where n is the number of time steps within a trajectory. The trajectory
buffer concatenates consecutive batches of experience data along the time axis, retaining their
ordering. This allows for random sampling of the trajectories within the buffer. The prioritised
trajectory buffer associates priorities with each subsequence of experience data broken up by the
period. Prioritisation is implemented as done in the PER paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952.
