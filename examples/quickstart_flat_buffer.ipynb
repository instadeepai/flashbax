    "# Quickstart: Using the Flat Buffer with Flashbax\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to use the Flat Buffer, for experience replay in reinforcement learning tasks. The Flat Buffer operates by saving all experience data in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue and returns batches of uniformly sampled experience from it. This is akin to the buffer used in the [original DQN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602). "
