    "# Quickstart: Using the Prioritised Flat Buffer with Flashbax\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide demonstrates how to use the Prioritised Flat Buffer for experience replay in reinforcement learning tasks. The Prioritised Flat Buffer operates like a uniform flat buffer however it returns batches of sampled experience according to given priorities. This is akin to the buffer used in the [PER paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) by Schaul et al. (2015)."
